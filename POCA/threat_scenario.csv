TS1,"The adversary has sniffed the ¡°verification successful¡±, thus concludes that the process of execution sub-scenario is about to begin",0,28
TS1.1,"The adversary intercepts and drops of the ¡°execution reminder¡±, thus the subsequent process of execution sub-scenario is interrupted",1,27.5
TS1.2,"The adversary interferes with the transmission of ""execution reminder"" to delay the subsequent process of execution sub-scenario",1,29.25
TS1.3,"The adversary interferes with the transmission of ""execution reminder"" to delay the subsequent process of execution sub-scenario",1,27
TS2,The adversary has discovered and copied the reserved ¡°TSR cancel¡± command file in TSRS,0,28
TS2.1,"The adversary tampers ""TSR cancel"" into ¡°TSR execution¡±, then wait for the time to upload it to the CTC mainframe",1,31
TS2.1.1,"The adversary has sniffed the ¡°execution reminder¡±, thus concludes that the dispatcher is about to issue the ¡°TSR execution¡±",2,28
TS2.1.1.1,"The adversary replaces the ""TSR execution"" to be sent on CTC with the counterfeit ""TSR execution"" to maliciously trigger the TSR cancellation sub-scenario",3,27
TS3,"The adversary has sniffed the ¡°TSR execution¡±, thus concludes that TSRS is about to split and convert this command",0,28
TS3.1,"The adversary tampers with the configuration file for splitting ¡°TSR execution¡± on TSRS, and make the split commands failed to be verified",1,29
TS3.1.1,"The adversary tampers with the failed verification result as ""success"" to deceive TSRS that the commands have been successfully issued, thus the subsequent process of execution sub-scenario is interrupted",2,29.75
TS4,The adversary has sniffed the ¡°TSR execution (RBC)¡± thus concludes that the train is about to be speed restricted,0,28
TS4.1,"The adversary intercepts and drops of the ¡°TSR command (RBC)¡±, thus the subsequent process of execution sub-scenario is interrupted",1,27.5
TS4.1.1,"After intercepting the original command, the adversary counterfeits a wrong ""TSR command"" and issues it, resulting in the train not being speed restricted",2,28
TS4.1.2,"After intercepting, the adversary tampers with the speed limit value, TSR starting position and TSR mileage contents within ¡°TSR command¡±, resulting in an insufficient speed restriction",2,29.75
